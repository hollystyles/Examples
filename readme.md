## Examples - of object orientation
Can OOP be beautiful? I think definitely when it's in the small. This personal repo created just for fun, is an experiment of a number of concepts I am interested in:

* Folder hierachy for projects and their files.
* Devision of code into modules.
* Cross platform programs using .Net Core.
* Seperation of the core application domain logic from its representatio in a user interface
* Explore Blazor WebAssembly

### TicTacToe
An implementation of the ubiquitous game played on a 9 cell grid, where the winner is the first to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The game can be played automatically and headless (no UI) in tests, in a terminal or in a browser (Blazor WebAssembly). You can play against an extremely naive AI or a friend.
